2.6.3
^^^^^

   to the bundle changes API.

   from the Juju API server (#344)

2.6.1
^^^^^
Wednesday August 21 2019

 * Pylibjuju now validates arguments correctly, instead of relying on default
   positional argument values.

2.6.0
^^^^^
Wednesday August 14 2019

* Update facade methods for Juju 2.6.6
* Pylibjuju release now follows the cadence of Juju releases, which also
  includes bumping the version number to follow suit.
* Pinned API facades. All facades in Pylibjuju are now pinned to a set of
  facade versions that is more conservative to prevent breakages against new
  features. The ability to override the pinned facades and specify your own
  facade versions is possible upon connection to a controller or model.
* Cross model relations (CMR) when deploying and adding relations. Additionally
  getting information about the CMR offers are available on the model.
* Cross model relations (CMR) in bundles.
* Ability to export bundle including overlays.
* Manual provisioning without a ubuntu user (#335)
* Addition of remote applications when adding relations via SAAS blocks
* Applying topological sorting to bundle changes API response, allows deployment
  of complex bundles possible.
* Updated definitions types to include the latest information from Juju.
* Keyword arguments (`unknown_field` in code) are now available on Juju
  responses.
